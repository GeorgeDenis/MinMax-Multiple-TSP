# Abstract
The Multi-Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP) is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem that generalizes the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) by involving multiple salesmen operating from a single depot. The solution of mTSP has wide applications in logistics, delivery networks, and transportation systems. This paper presents a comprehensive genetic algorithm (GA) framework designed to solve mTSP efficiently by integrating adaptive route balancing, multi-opt local search (3-opt), and iterative hill climbing strategies. The proposed algorithm reduces the overall cost of the route while minimizing the longest route (min-max criterion) among the salesmen. The algorithm improves the classical GA by introducing balanced chromosome initialization, crossover mechanisms that preserve depot constraints, and global and local mutation strategies that mitigate route imbalance and promote diversity. The algorithm ran 30 times for each dataset, each time it ran 40000 iterations, and the population was made up of 100 individuals. The results in the benchmark data sets (eil51, berlin52, eil76) demonstrate consistent improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of route balancing and local optimization techniques in achieving near-optimal solutions.
